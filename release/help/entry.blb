  Citadel-86 formats all messages to your screen width.  Carriage-return
characters are treated as blanks unless followed by a blank, so paragraphs
should be indented.  To defeat the formatting for graphics or whatever,
indent every line at least one space.  This usually results in a mess so don't
bother.
